                    <strong>What kind of information do we collect? </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of information we may collect through your use of our Websites

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        1. "Personal Information," which is the type of information that specifically identifies
                        you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as
                        your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, precise geo location
                        information, credit card information and user names; and
                    </p>

                        identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-personal Information also
                        includes "<strong>Usage Data</strong>," which is anonymous data tied to your computer
                        and/or device, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Websites and
                        /or Apps, the browser you use and the date and time of your use of the Websites
                        and/or Apps,

                <p>
                    LogicTree IT may determine to make available or withdraw any App at our discretion.
                    We may stop any transaction, or take other actions as needed to restrict access
                    to or availability of any App that does not comply with this Agreement or that otherwise
                    might adversely affect end users. Any withdrawal of an App does not relieve you
                    of responsibility to ensure the App complies with this Agreement or to perform other
                    obligations under this Agreement. Subject to other terms of this Agreement, you
                    may withdraw an App from further submission and distribution at a specified date
                    by giving us notice. LogicTree IT will use commercially reasonable efforts to stop
                    any updates and resubmission of the App within 10 business days after we receive
                    such notice. Any withdrawal by you will apply only to future end user downloads
                    after the withdrawal date and not to downloads that have already occurred, unless
                    we determine otherwise at our discretion.
